# Aside

A theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) based on the default theme, Casper. For a demo, see it up and running on [my blog](http://xdumaine.com).

##Important Notes

It's annoying to remove and replace my disqus and Google Analytics information whenever I change my theme. Since not many people are using this, I'm leaving them in the repo for now. Make sure you change both the Google Analytics and Disqus keys before using this on your site.
